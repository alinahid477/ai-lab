The conversion logics are 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, 4.35 weeks in a month, 30 days in a monthFor example, \'7 days\' should be returned as 168. For example, \'3 months\' should be returned as 2192. Return only the numeric value, without units.

Do not provide sample input and response. Do not output additional texts.\nYou should provide explanation in the designated "explanation" field of the json object.\nYou also should provide a confidence score for your answer. If your confidence is lower than 0.7 then you can generate a follow up question such as: "I\'m sorry, what do you mean?". Your follow up question shold be bound to the "followup" field in the schema. If your confidence is higher than 0.7 then no need to ask any followup question. \nYou are allowed to engage in conversational chit-chat using relevant follow up questions leveraging the "followup" field in the json object.\n\n### Instruction:\nExtract command, time_duration and filepath from the user input. \nThe unit for time_duration must be in hours. If user mentions other units such as days, months, years etc you must convert that into hours. Do not apply any context when converting time_duration into hours. Simply convert based on this information: 24 hours in 1 day, 7 days in 1 week, 4.35 weeks in 1 month, 12 months in 1 year. For example: 3 months = 2192 hours, 7 days = 168 hours etc.\nDo not modify the filepath. Extract the filepath exactly as the user specifies it. If the user does not mention any file or filepath do not provide any randomly generated filepath. Instead provide "not_availabe" in the filepath field. \nSimilarly, if the user do not mention any time related information do not randomly generate time_duration. Instead provide 0 for time_duration field.\nFor example: \n- if the user asks "show me last 7 days worth of logs", your answer should extract information such as command=logs, time_duration=168, filepath=not_availabe.\n- if the user asks "show me logs for the last 24hrs", your answer should extract information such as command=logs, time_duration=24, filepath=not_availabe.\n- if the user asks "logs of last 24hrs", your answer should extract information such as command=logs, time_duration=24, filepath=not_availabe.\n- if the user asks "show me csv logs from file /tmp/myfile-20250311.csv", your answer should extract information such as command=csvlogs, filepath=/tmp/myfile-20250311.csv\n- if the user asks "csv logs", your answer should extract information such as command=csvlogs, filepath=not_availabe, followup=from what file\n- if the user asks "show logs from file /tmp/myfile-20250311.csv", your answer should extract information such as command=csvlogs, filepath=/tmp/myfile-20250311.csv\n- if the user asks "display logs from csv /tmp/myfile-20250311.csv", your answer should extract information such as command=csvlogs, filepath=/tmp/myfile-20250311.csv\n- if the user asks "get logs from file /tmp/myfile-20250311.csv", your answer should extract information such as command=csvlogs, filepath=/tmp/myfile-20250311.csv\n- if the user asks "summarize logs from file /tmp/myfile-20250311.csv" your answer should extract information such as command=summarizelogs and filepath=/tmp/myfile-20250311.csv\n- if the user asks "summarize logs" your answer should extract information such as command=summarizelogs, filepath=not_availabe,followup=from what file? \n- if the user asks "classify logs from file /tmp/logs/myappocp_202503182003.csv" your answer should extract information such as command=classifylogs, filepath=/tmp/logs/myappocp_202503182003.csv, time_duration=0 \n\nPossible commands are: \n- csvlogs\n- logs\n- kafkalogs\n- classifylogs\n- summarizelogs\n\n### Input:\n"get logs for last 24hours"\n\n### Response (valid JSON only): ', 'stream': False, 'keep_alive': '0m', 'format': 'json'}
