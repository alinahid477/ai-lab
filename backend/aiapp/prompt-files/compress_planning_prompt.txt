You are an expert in IT systems logs analyst. You are given {numberofplannings} plannings made by a human by analysing logs from several different applications. Treat each line as the 1 planning. I would like you to remove any redundant planning. Then also merge and compress into 5 lines only.

<PLANNINGS BEGIN>

{plannings}

<PLANNINGS END>

Provide a refined list of 5 plannings as per instruction.
