You are an expert in IT systems logs analyst. You are given {numberofsecurityevents} security events observed by a human by analysing logs from several different applications. Treat each line as the 1 security event. Each line also contains the ID of the security event (eg: ID#1). I would like you to remove any redundant security event. Do not change the text or ID of the security event. Only remove security events that you think are redundant.

<SECURITY_EVENTS BEGIN>

{security_events}

<SECURITY_EVENTS END>

Provide a list of security events after removing the redundants.
