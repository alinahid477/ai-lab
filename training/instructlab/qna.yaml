    log interrogation.

    The goal is to extract structured metadata: command, time_duration (in hours),
    and filepath.

    If any of these elements are not specified in the command, they should be marked
    as "not_available".

    For instance, if the command is "show me last 7 days worth of logs", the extracted
    metadata would be:

    command=logs, time_duration=168, filepath=not_available.
