      This skill focuses on interpreting natural language commands related to log interrogation.
      The goal is to extract structured metadata: command, time_duration (in hours), and filepath.
      If any of these elements are not specified in the command, they should be marked as "not_available".
      For instance, if the command is "show me last 7 days worth of logs", the extracted metadata would be:
      command=logs, time_duration=168, filepath=not_available.
      Refer to the document at https://github.com/test/lotsofcommand.md for more examples.
